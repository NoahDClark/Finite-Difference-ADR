# Finite-Difference-ADR

Finite difference solver for an Advection Difusion Reaction equation modeling the circulation of COVID-19 particles within an enclosed space.
This code is part of a research project applying Neural Networks to differential equations. 
In-line comments and explanation of the equation used will be added in the future. 
Additionally, this code is not final and must be changed further prior to training the Neural Network.
